      "options": [
        "Cell wall composition",
        "Type and number of nucleic acid strands",
        "Presence of mitochondria",
        "Mode of photosynthesis"

      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Viruses are classified based on their structural characteristics including the type of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) and whether it is single-stranded or double-stranded. Viruses do not have cell walls, mitochondria, or perform photosynthesis as they are acellular.",
      "difficulty": "moderate",
